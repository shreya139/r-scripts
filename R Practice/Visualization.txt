a <- seq(min(my_data), max(my_data), length = 100)    # define range of values spanning the dataset
cdf_function <- function(x) {    # computes prob. for a single value

The normal distribution:
Is centered around one value, the mean
Is symmetric around the mean
Is defined completely by its mean ( μ ) and standard deviation (  σ  )
Always has the same proportion of observations within a given distance of the mean (for example, 95% within 2  σ )
The standard deviation is the average distance between a value and the mean value.
Calculate the mean using the mean() function.
Calculate the standard deviation using the sd() function or manually. 
Standard units describe how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean. The z-score, or number of standard deviations an observation  x  is away from the mean  μ :
Z=x−μσ 
Compute standard units with the scale() function.
Important: to calculate the proportion of values that meet a certain condition, use the mean() function on a logical vector. Because TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE is converted to 0, taking the mean of this vector yields the proportion of TRUE.

# calculate the mean and standard deviation manually
